1. What is DevOps?
->It is a set of practices and tools that automate and integrate the process between Software Development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams to deliver applications and services faster and more reliably.

2. Why does DevOps need?
-> It is needed to enable faster, reliable, and continuous delivery of high-quality software through collaboration, automation, and monitoring.

3. How We Work with DevOps in Real-Time?
-> It works by automating the entire software lifecycle — from coding, building, testing, and deploying to monitoring — using CI/CD pipelines, IaC, and collaboration tools to deliver reliable applications faster.

* Key Features of DevOps:
i.Collaboration – Dev + Ops teams work together.
ii. Automation – Automates builds, tests, deployments, and monitoring.
iii. Continuous Integration (CI) – Frequent code integration & testing.
iv. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) – Fast, reliable releases.
v. Scalability – Works with containers, microservices, cloud infra.
vi. Monitoring & Logging – Continuous visibility into app performance.
vii. Security (DevSecOps) – Security integrated at every stage.
viii. Agility – Quick responses to market and customer needs.
ix. Reduced Failures – Automated pipelines reduce human errors.
x. Faster Time to Market – Quicker release cycles with confidence.
